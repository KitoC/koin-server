# koin-server

This is a simple server that collects data from Coinspot and calculates the cost basis from each coin you own and also calculates a few totals.

It uses a central user-service microservice that I have built (https://github.com/KitoC/folk-service) and the coinspot read only api.

TODO:
- Add installation and setup instrcutions to README
- Add Travis pipeline to Github
